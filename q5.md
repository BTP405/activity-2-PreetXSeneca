# Q5 - Discuss the approaches!

## Approach  1

This approach uses a function `doubleL(n)` that first creates an empty list `res`, then uses a for loop to append the double of each number in the range `n` (excluding n) to the list. The function then returns the list. The for loop outside the function iterates over the list returned by `doubleL(5)` and prints each element.

## Approach  2

This approach uses a list comprehension to generate a list of the double of each number in the range  5. The for loop then iterates over this list, printing each element. List comprehensions are often faster than loops because they use a more optimized internal mechanism for iterating over the collection.

There is a special bytecode instruction `LIST_APPEND` that will append the current value to the list we are constructing.

## Approach  3

This approach uses a function `doubleG(n)` that uses the `yield` keyword to create a generator. The function generates the double of each number in the range `n` one at a time. The for loop outside the function iterates over the generator returned by `doubleG(5)` and prints each element followed by a colon.

## Generator Function

The function `doubleG(n)` is a generator function. The `yield` keyword is used in Python to create a generator function. A generator function is a type of function that is memory efficient. It allows us to produce a sequence of results over time, rather than computing them all at once and sending them back as a list.

The advantage of using such a function is that it is highly memory-efficient and increases the overall performance of the code. It saves memory because it stores the values to be returned as local variables state, and also each time it executes the function, it need not start from the beginning as the previous states are retained.
